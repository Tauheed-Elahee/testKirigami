# Timeline

## Before 2019-08 (August 2019)
Started project in Feburary. I did not use a version control system at the time. I did not make a log/journal/diary of this project.

## 2019-08 - 2019-11
Used git and github. None of my contributions show as my own as I did not set up my sshkeys with github. Still no log/journal/diary.

## 2019-11-17 - 2019-11-20
Was able to assign commits to me. Still no log/journal/diary.

## 2019-11-20
Was able to finally connect C++ to QML and be able to press a button in qml and have a cout something to the terminal.
Originally it only output to the terminal when exiting the program then something happened, probably added test.txt or more likely did a deleted the build directory and did a clean build. After this cout was outputting to the terminal right when I press a button instead of when I quit the program.
